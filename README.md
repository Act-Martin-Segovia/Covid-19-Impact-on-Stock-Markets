# Covid-19-Impact-on-Stock-Markets
The COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in late 2019, has had profound effects on global economies and financial markets. In this report, I try to analyze the impact of the pandemic on selected stock markets and sectors, focusing on the American and Canadian markets, as well as specific sectors such as travel and real estate.

These are the markets and corresponding stocks that I considered for this analysis:
- Overall American Market (SPY): The SPY ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index, representing the overall American stock market. 
- Overall Canadian Market (XIU.TO): The XIU.TO ETF tracks the performance of the S&P/TSX 60 Index, representing the overall Canadian stock market.
- Travel Sector (DAL): Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) represents the travel sector, specifically focusing on the airline industry. 
- Real Estate Sector (SPG): Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) represents the real estate sector, particularly focusing on the retail real estate industry.
- Precious Metals - Gold (GLD), Silver (SLV), Platinum (PPLT): We also analyzed the performance of precious metals, including gold (GLD), silver (SLV), and platinum (PPLT).
