# Covid-19-Impact-on-Stock-Markets
The COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in late 2019, has had profound effects on global economies and financial markets. In this report, I try to analyze the impact of the pandemic on selected stock markets and sectors, focusing on the American and Canadian markets, as well as specific sectors such as travel and real estate.

## Data Analysis
I gathered daily data from January 2020 to March 2023. This analysis includes the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, alongside the closing prices of selected stocks representing different markets and sectors.
These are the markets and corresponding stocks that I considered for this analysis:
- Overall American Market (SPY): The SPY ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index, representing the overall American stock market. 
- Overall Canadian Market (XIU.TO): The XIU.TO ETF tracks the performance of the S&P/TSX 60 Index, representing the overall Canadian stock market.
- Travel Sector (DAL): Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) represents the travel sector, specifically focusing on the airline industry. 
- Real Estate Sector (SPG): Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) represents the real estate sector, particularly focusing on the retail real estate industry.
- Precious Metals - Gold (GLD), Silver (SLV), Platinum (PPLT): We also analyzed the performance of precious metals, including gold (GLD), silver (SLV), and platinum (PPLT). These assets are often considered safe-haven investments during times of economic uncertainty.

## Findings
Global COVID-19 statistics reveal staggering figures, with a total of 676,570,149 confirmed cases and 6,881,802 confirmed deaths recorded worldwide.

Linear correlation analysis reveals significant relationships between confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and stock prices:
- The overall American market (SPY) shows a moderate positive correlation (0.48) with confirmed cases.
- The overall Canadian market (XIU.TO) exhibits a stronger positive correlation (0.68) with confirmed cases.
- The real estate sector (SPG) demonstrates a moderate positive correlation (0.4) with confirmed cases.
- The overall American market (SPY) displays a strong positive correlation (0.73) with death cases.
- The overall Canadian market (XIU.TO) shows an even stronger positive correlation (0.86) with death cases.
- The real estate sector (SPG) exhibits a moderate positive correlation (0.6) with death cases.

Upon the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown measures, all analyzed markets experienced a significant downturn. This downturn reflects the widespread uncertainty and economic disruption caused by the unprecedented global health crisis. However, it can be  observed that the precious metals markets, especially gold and silver, were the first markets to peak after the lockdown. This phenomenon can be attributed to their status as reserve assets or safe-haven investments. Following the initial downturn, the markets began a trajectory of recovery, gradually regaining lost ground and moving towards pre-pandemic levels. 

Focusing on the marketsâ€™ volatility, which is a key indicator of market risk, it experienced notable changes after the onset of the pandemic. I analyzed the volatilities for three key markets:
- SPY: volatility before pandemic 22.73 VS volatility after pandemic 52.97
- XIU.TO: volatility before pandemic 0.96 VS volatility after pandemic 3.38
- SPG: volatility before pandemic 11.33 VS volatility after pandemic 29.49
The significant increase in volatility shows the heightened uncertainty and market turbulence during the pandemic period. 

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights the profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial markets, characterized by an initial downturn followed by a gradual recovery towards pre-pandemic levels. It also shows evidence of the incredible increase of volatility due to the environment of high risk and uncertainty. Additionally, evidence of how precious metals like gold and silver are used as reserve assets by investors is observed.
